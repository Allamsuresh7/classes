            <img src="Prabhas, Deepika Padukone in.jpg" alt="Prabhas" height="300">
            <p style="color: violet;">The first glimpse of Kalki 2898 AD was unveiled at the 2023 San Diego Comic Con (SDCC).
                 “When the world is taken over by darkness, a force will rise,” reads the video as we see armed soldiers storming a fort.
                  Deepika Padukone appears in short hair in a file of female recruits.<br> 
                  The teaser oozes dystopia and Indofuturism as Prabhas makes his entry in a cool exosuit.
                  “What is Project K?,” he is asked, while catching a deadly lance with his hand.<p><br>
                  <p style="color: violet;">The title of Nag Ashwin’s Project K has been officially revealed as Kalki 2898 AD.
                     Starring a massive Pan-Indian cast of Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan,
                      Kamal Haasan and Disha Patani and Saswata Chatterjee, the film is an epic, mythology-inspired sci-fi spectacular set in the future</p>
